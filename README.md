## Introduction
This project analyzes the **Concrete Slump dataset** to predict slump values using:
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring data readiness.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Extracting insights using various statistical measures.
- **Machine Learning**: Building a Linear Regression model.
- **User Interface**: Creating a web-based application for easy predictions.

---

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning was performed using **Pandas** to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. Key steps include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Missing values were filled using mean, median, or mode depending on the column characteristics.

## Machine Learning Model
A **Linear Regression** model was developed using **Scikit-learn** to predict slump values based on material proportions.

### Model Workflow:
1. **Feature Selection**:
   - Input features: Cement, water, fine aggregate, and coarse aggregate amounts.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53f3a268-733b-4d4b-8001-ccc3dff90eac)

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Assessed prediction accuracy.
   - **R-squared (RÂ²)**: Evaluated the model's explanatory power.
